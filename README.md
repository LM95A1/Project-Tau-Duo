# Project-Tau-Duo
Project Four Repository for Group Two, designated codename Tau Duo.

## Work in Progress

---

### Overview

Project Tau Duo aims to leverage machine learning and various technologies to provide a solution to a meaningful problem. This README serves as a guide to understanding what the project is about, the technologies used, and the steps to get it up and running.

---

### Problem Statement

To be determined. The goal is to find a problem that's worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing. This could range from health data analytics to predicting natural disasters.

---

### Data Source

To be determined. The project will use a dataset with at least 100 records for analysis. The dataset will be chosen based on the problem we aim to solve.

---

### Technologies Used

1. **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn or other relevant ML libraries.
2. **Data Handling**: Python Pandas
3. **Data Visualization**: Python Matplotlib, JavaScript Plotly, or Tableau
4. **Web Development**: HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
5. **Mapping**: JavaScript Leaflet (if applicable)
6. **Database**: SQL Database or MongoDB Database
7. **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud SQL or Amazon AWS

(Note: At least two from the above list will be used, depending on the project requirements)

---

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (if using JavaScript technologies)
- Relevant Python libraries (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib` etc.)
- Database engine compatible with the selected database technology
- Cloud account (if using Google Cloud SQL or Amazon AWS)

---

### Setup and Installation

The setup and installation steps will be updated once the project development progresses. This will include steps to set up your development environment, install dependencies, and get the project running on your local machine.
